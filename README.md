# Cooper
This repository will provide the codes and data used in the AAAI'24 paper, [*COOPER: Coordinating Specialized Agents towards a Complex Dialogue Goal*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.11792.pdf).

The "data/" directory provides the annotated data we used in our experiments. 
The other codes will be later released soon.
